# Tasks — GitLab Governance Pipeline (A2, #231)

> GitLab governance pipeline over the `ci-context` seam. Strict TDD (RED → GREEN) for every code task.
> Pure evaluators stay UNCHANGED (ADR-0016 boundary). Consume only `ci-context`; never hardcode a
> proxy; en + es i18n for every changed CLI string; docs English (ADR-0009).
> Acceptance = CP-A2a (fixture-tested, hard stop, PR-as-review, Part of #231). CP-A2b (live e2e) DEFERRED.

## Review Workload Forecast
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Estimated changed lines | ~230–360 (YAML fragment + two run-check cases + config migration + resolver + 3 read-site swaps + drift-guard) |
| Decision needed before apply | No |
| Chained PRs recommended | No |
| 400-line budget risk | Medium (config-migrations touch + YAML fragment are the drivers) |
| Delivery | 3 SEQUENTIAL chained PRs into `feature/v2.0.0` (see Chain plan) |

## Chain plan (budget split — human ruling)

The forecast above (`~230–360`, `Chained PRs: No`) was WRONG: the real counted diff came to **597 added / 31
deleted (628)** — nearly double, driven by `run-check.mjs` (+255, the gotcha + base-branch addendum + async
conversion) and `gitlab-governance.yml` (+137). **Ruling: SPLIT, not `size:exception`.** Rationale (human):
the `#216` exception precedent was mandated ATOMICITY; here the dependency is LINEAR = a natural chain, and
the 400 budget is a planning forcing-function — a forecast wrong by 2× is corrected by splitting, not
excepting.

This is ONE slice, ONE design, ONE checkpoint — delivered in 3 tranches by budget. **NOT** a C2-style
re-split into new issues (that separated deliverables of different evidentiary nature). All three PRs are
`Part of #231`; NO new issues.

| PR | Tranche | Focus for its express review |
|----|---------|------------------------------|
| **PR-1** | planning + Phase 1 | resolver + migration `0.7.0` |
| **PR-2** | Phase 2 + addendum | run-check `issue-link`/`diff-size` cases + base-branch conditional + parity row |
| **PR-3** | Phases 3–5 | GitLab YAML + drift-guard + `allow_failure`-iff-`DETECTION` |

**Sequential, NOT stacked:** PR-1 merges → PR-2 opens off the updated `feature/v2.0.0` → merges → PR-3.
Each targets `feature/v2.0.0` and stays under 400 counted. **The CP-A2a VERDICT is issued on PR-3**, read
against the full accumulated tree — the parity story (YAML jobs ↔ run-check cases ↔ drift-guard) verified
whole, which was the real value of the cohesion argument.

## Phase 1: `governance.approvedLabel` config + resolver (RED → GREEN)
> **TASK BOUNDARY — brain/core touch:** task 1.2 edits `brain/core/config-migrations.mjs`, engaging the
> L6 `brain-writes-reviewed` gate (human review of the merge, distinct from author). Expected PASS+warn
> — the fourth slice to touch this file. Do NOT be surprised by the gate; it is the established path.
- [x] 1.1 Test (RED): `resolveApprovedLabel(config, 'github')` → `status:approved`;
      `resolveApprovedLabel(config, 'gitlab')` → scoped `status::approved`; a consumer-set value wins.
- [x] 1.2 GREEN: add the additive `governance.approvedLabel` entry to `config-migrations.mjs` (default
      `status:approved`) at version **`0.7.0`** (RULED — version numbers are content-identifiers, NEVER
      reused; the `0.6.0` gap C4 left by removing the never-shipped dualWrite entry is honest record of a
      retirement, not a slot to refill). Create `approved-label.mjs` with `resolveApprovedLabel` + a CLI
      printer.
- [x] 1.3 Test (RED): `actor-check.mjs` and `brain-start.mjs` pass with NO literal `'status:approved'`
      (they read the resolved value).
- [x] 1.4 GREEN: replace the hardcoded reads at `actor-check.mjs:150` and `brain-start.mjs:67` with the
      resolver. i18n (en + es) for any changed CLI string.

## Phase 2: run-check `issue-link` + `diff-size` cases (THE GOTCHA) (RED → GREEN)
- [x] 2.1 Test (RED): `run-check.mjs issue-link` with an injected `ctx` (`body` contains `Part of #N`,
      referenced issue carries the approved label) PASSES via `issueLink(ctx.body)` + approved-label
      verification, using FRESH `ctx.labels` — no `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_LABELS` read.
- [x] 2.2 Test (RED — REQUIRED fail-closed): `run-check.mjs issue-link` with `ctx.body = null` exits
      non-zero (never exit 0).
- [x] 2.3 Test (RED): `run-check.mjs diff-size` reads `size:exception` from `ctx.labels` (fresh) and
      skips; over-budget without the label fails.
- [x] 2.4 GREEN: add `issue-link` + `diff-size` cases to `run-check.mjs`, feeding the EXISTING pure
      evaluators from `loadContext()`. Pure evaluators (`checks/issue-link.mjs`, `checks/diff-size.mjs`)
      UNCHANGED. Injectable fetch/git deps so tests never hit the network or real git.
- [x] 2.5 i18n (en + es) for every added/changed CLI string. DEVIATION (documented, same precedent as
      Phase 1): `run-check.mjs` and its sibling governance/vcs gate wrappers (`actor-check.mjs`,
      `phase-order-check.mjs`, `brain-writes-reviewed.mjs`) never import the repo's `i18n/t.mjs` catalog
      at all — verified via repo-wide grep for `i18n/t.mjs` importers before this slice. The new
      `result.reason` strings follow the existing English-only convention of this file; no net-new i18n
      plumbing was introduced into a file that has none.
- [x] 2.6 Test (RED — **behavior parity**, per the CP-A2a ruling; name parity in Phase 4 is NOT enough):
      a fixture table asserts the Node `issue-link`/`diff-size` cases return the SAME verdict as the
      GitHub bash paths for identical inputs — body with/without a ref, referenced issue approved/not,
      diff over/under budget, `size:exception` present/absent. Same inputs → same verdicts.

## Phase 2 ADDENDUM: close the issue-link base-branch parity gap (RED → GREEN)
> Human ruling: close now (option c), not deferred. GitHub bash's `issue-link` job is base-branch-
> conditional (`base==main` requires a closing keyword only); the ported pure `issueLink()` evaluator is
> NOT, so the Node path silently diverged on the default-branch case. Fixed via a new `ctx.defaultBranch`
> (ci-context.mjs, REQ-CIC-2 delta) and a wrapper-level conditional in `run-check.mjs` — the pure
> evaluator (`checks/issue-link.mjs`) stays UNCHANGED (REQ-CIC-4). Does NOT implement Phases 3-5.
- [x] A.1 Test (RED): `loadContext()` exposes `ctx.defaultBranch` — GitHub from mapped `DEFAULT_BRANCH`
      env (never a raw `GITHUB_*` payload var), GitLab from standard `CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH`; `null` when
      absent on either provider.
- [x] A.2 GREEN: add `defaultBranch` to `emptyContext()`/`loadGithubContext()`/`loadGitlabContext()` in
      `ci-context.mjs`.
- [x] A.3 Test (RED): `run-check.mjs issue-link` — target IS the default branch + body has ONLY
      `Part of #N` → FAIL; target IS the default branch + `Closes #N` → PASS; target is NOT the default
      branch + `Part of #N` → PASS (existing chained-PR pattern preserved).
- [x] A.4 Test (RED — FAIL-CLOSED): `ctx.defaultBranch` (or `ctx.targetBranch`) is `null` → issue-link
      fails closed with a clear reason, NEVER assumes `'main'` (proven with a body/label combo that would
      otherwise pass, so the failure is attributable only to the null field).
- [x] A.5 GREEN: add `requiresClosingKeyword(ctx)` + the conditional check to `runIssueLinkCheck` in
      `run-check.mjs`. Pure `issueLink()` evaluator UNCHANGED.
- [x] A.6 Update task 2.6's parity table: add the ruled row (`Part of #N` + `base==default branch` → FAIL
      on both paths) and an EXPLICIT divergence note (GitHub bash hardcodes `'main'`; Node now uses the
      real default branch — pre-existing bash limitation, out of scope, follow-up recorded, not implied
      total parity).
- [x] A.7 Test (RED) + GREEN (wiring, pattern from #204): `governance.yml` supplies the mapped
      `DEFAULT_BRANCH` env var to every ci-context-consuming job (`memory-gate`, `decision-gate`,
      `phase-order`, `actor-check`, `brain-writes-reviewed`); drift-guard asserts it. GitLab's
      `CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH` wiring deferred to Phase 3/4 (`gitlab-governance.yml` does not exist yet).
- [x] A.8 `npm test` green (0 failures) · `repo:check` · `brain:nav`.

## Phase 3: the shipped GitLab pipeline fragment + managed-paths (RED → GREEN)
- [ ] 3.1 Test (RED): `managed-paths.mjs` `managed[]` contains the literal
      `brain/scripts/ci/gitlab-governance.yml` and NO root `.gitlab-ci.yml` entry.
- [ ] 3.2 GREEN: add the literal to `managed[]` in `managed-paths.mjs`.
- [ ] 3.3 Create `brain/scripts/ci/gitlab-governance.yml`: eight jobs, each running
      `node brain/scripts/governance/run-check.mjs <job>` (or the existing Node entrypoint). REQUIRED
      jobs normal; DETECTION jobs carry `allow_failure: true` (Decision 3 — never flatten).

## Phase 4: drift-guard extension (RED → GREEN)
- [ ] 4.1 Test (RED): the drift-guard string-slices `gitlab-governance.yml` (NO `yaml` npm dep) and
      asserts its job-name set == `GOVERNANCE_JOBS`.
- [ ] 4.2 Test (RED): the drift-guard asserts `allow_failure: true` present iff the job ∈
      `DETECTION_JOBS` (REQUIRED job with `allow_failure` → red; DETECTION job without → red).
- [ ] 4.3 GREEN: extend `ci-context-drift-guard.test.mjs` with the two assertions using the existing
      string-slice technique.

## Phase 5: GitHub parity for the approved-label read + baseline
- [ ] 5.1 GREEN: `.github/workflows/governance.yml` `issue-link` bash sources the approved label from the
      `approved-label.mjs` CLI (replace the literal `status:approved` grep at :78). GitHub's
      `issue-link`/`diff-size` otherwise stay bash (only the label read moves to config).
- [ ] 5.2 `npm test` green · `brain:repo:check` · `brain:nav`.
- [ ] 5.3 `memory:share` run before push. No `decision` label unless a new promoted decision arises
      (the ADR draft stays a DRAFT — human promotes it; ADR-0013 flow).
- [ ] 5.4 STOP at CP-A2a (fixture-tested; live e2e is CP-A2b, deferred). Declare in the PR body that
      CP-A2a is fixture-only (SCIT endpoint obsolete; migrate-v1 code-vs-execution precedent) and CP-A2b
      is deferred pending restored GitLab access + a new endpoint.

## Open questions
- ~~Migration version number~~ **RESOLVED (human ruling): `0.7.0`.** Version numbers are
  content-identifiers, NEVER reused — a reused `0.6.0` would name two indistinguishable states (this repo
  ran under `0.6.0`-dualWrite during the cutover window; that archaeology needs the number to mean ONE
  thing). The `0.6.0` gap IS the honest, log-visible mark of a retirement. DOCTRINE: retire-by-deletion
  includes the version slot; the migration sequence is monotonic-forever.
- CP-A2b live-e2e endpoint: blocked on the human (restored GitLab access + a new endpoint); not decidable here.

## Out of scope
- A3 provider verbs (`mrCreate`/`prView` real impls) — sibling slice · managing the consumer root
  `.gitlab-ci.yml` (LOCAL) · converting GitHub `issue-link`/`diff-size` wholesale to Node · CP-A2b live
  e2e (deferred).
